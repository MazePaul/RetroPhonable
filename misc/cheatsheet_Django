In Django, an app is a self-contained module that provides a specific functionality within a project.
Some examples of apps in a Django project could be:

A blog app that handles creating, editing, and displaying blog posts.
An authentication app that handles user authentication and registration.
A shopping cart app that handles adding and removing items from a user's shopping cart.

To create a new app:
python manage.py startapp projectnam


Models in a nutshell:
Change your models (in models.py).
Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.
